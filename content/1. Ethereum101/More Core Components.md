1. [Consensus](Consensus.md) algorithm: Ethereum used to use Bitcoin’s consensus model, Nakamoto Consensus, which uses sequential single-signature blocks, weighted in importance by Proof-of-Work (PoW) to determine the longest chain and therefore the current state. 
2. Ethereum's new consensus mechanism is called proof-of-stake (PoS). PoS is a more secure, less energy-intensive, and more scalable consensus mechanism than the previous proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. In a PoS system, validators are selected to propose and validate new blocks based on the amount of ETH they have staked. PoS is more energy-efficient than PoW because it does not require validators to solve complex mathematical puzzles to propose new blocks.
3. Clients: Ethereum has several interoperable implementations of the client software, the most prominent of which are Go-Ethereum (Geth) and OpenEthereum. The others are Erigon, Nethermind and Turbo-geth. OpenEthereum is being deprecated to transition to Erigon, which is the former Turbo-geth.
